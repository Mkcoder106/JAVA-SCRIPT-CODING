 <p>Mobile devices, tablets, and computers have fundamentally transformed how people interact with technology, access information, and perform daily tasks. Mobile devices—including smartphones and tablets—are essentially small, portable computers designed for use on the go. They are typically battery-powered, feature touchscreens, and support wireless connectivity like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks, enabling users to browse the internet, communicate, and access a wide variety of applications from virtually anywhere. Smartphones combine the features of traditional cell phones with advanced computing capabilities, allowing users to make calls, send messages, take photos, and run productivity or entertainment apps. Tablets, a subset of mobile devices, offer larger screens than smartphones, making them ideal for activities such as reading, watching videos, drawing, or editing documents. Tablets usually run mobile operating systems like iOS or Android and rely on virtual keyboards and touch input, though many support external keyboards and styluses for enhanced productivity. Their portability and versatility have made them popular for both personal and professional use, often serving as a bridge between smartphones and traditional computers
